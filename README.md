# Software Delivery Cycle is a process that produces software that is good quality that's inexpensive with minimal time usage

# Test driven development is a process that relies on test cases so the code can be improved to pass said tests

# Continuous Integration is merging working copies into a mainline frequently

# Continuous Delivery involves producing software in short cycles

# Configuration management is a process that maintains a product's performance

# Containerization is packing up software and what's needed for it run so it can run on any infrastructure

# Cloud Scalability is ability to increase/decrease IT resources depending on demand

# Software architecture is what the higher level components of software is made of and how they work together

# A software architecture pattern is a solution to problems that commonly occur in the architecture

# Client/Server is a structure that splits tasks between servers and clients

# Peer to peer refers to an architecture that splits tasks between peers

# Monolithic refers to when an app uses a single development stack (example: using one py file for a python app)

# Microservices is different since it is one app but uses components that run and communicate together.

# REST (Representational state transfer) defines sets of constraints to be used to make Web services, basically they are like rules or principles.
